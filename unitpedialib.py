In 1743, the Lyonnais physicist Jean-Pierre Christin was working independently of Celsius, and developed a scale where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water. In 1744, coincident with the death of Anders Celsius, the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) reversed Celsius's scale.", "The Celsius scale was based on 0 °C for the freezing point of water and 100 °C for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure.", "Derived from an SI unit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"))

In his initial scale (which is not the final Fahrenheit scale), the zero point was determined by placing the thermometer in a mixture \"of ice, of water, and of ammonium chloride (salis Armoniaci) or even of sea salt\". This combination forms a eutectic system which stabilizes its temperature automatically: 0 °F was defined to be that stable temperature. The second point, 96 degrees, was approximately the human body's temperature (sanguine hominis sani, the blood of a healthy man).", "On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and the boiling point is 212 °F (at standard atmospheric pressure).

Kelvin calculated that absolute zero was equivalent to −273 °C on the air thermometers of the time. This absolute scale is known today as the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale.", "Until 2018, the kelvin was defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water (0.01 °C or 32.018 °F). In other words, it was defined such that the triple point of water is exactly 273.16 K. On 16 November 2018, a new definition was adopted, in terms of a fixed value of the Boltzmann constant.

This was a convenient definition, but hard to replicate precisely. In 1799, the Kilogramme des Archives, a platinum artefact, replaced it as a standard mass sample. Later, the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system, and remained so until May 20, 2019. In spite of best efforts to maintain it, the IPK diverged from its replicas by approximately 50 micrograms since their manufacture late in the 19th century. This led to efforts to develop measurement technology precise enough to allow replacing the kilogram artefact with a definition based directly on physical fundamental constants. This was achieved in 2018, with a definition in terms of the Planck constant.", "The kilogram is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10^(−34) when expressed in the unit J⋅s, which is equal to kg⋅m2⋅s^(−1), where the metre and the second are defined in terms of c and ΔνCs.", "Yes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kilogram"))
